Note that this journal entry (and some of the other journal entries which I’ve published on karbytes) use a name which contains a calendar day which is not the same calendar day as the day at which that journal entry was either created or else most recently updated. That is in order to make it easier for me to look up specific journal entries based on the approximate time I remember writing those journal entries (and so that I can cram more journal entries into a particular “micro directory” of my blog if I happen to be extra prolific during some phase not spanning more than one day (and I do that to avoid overcrowding specific individual journal entries with content which does not fit the themes of those journal entries)). For instance, this journal entry mostly discusses events related to me acquiring a new Android phone and testing its functionality while other journal entries in this journal entry’s “micro directory” (i.e. KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_19) focus on other subject matter. To be clear, I use the same convention for naming all of the files of karbytes which I classify as journal entries (and that convention is as follows: “karbytes_[DAY]_[MONTH]_[YEAR]” where [DAY] is a two-digit number representing a particular calendar day (e.g. 01 or 31), [MONTH] is the name of one of the twelve Gregorian calendar months in all capitalized letters (i.e. JANUARY or DECEMBER), and [YEAR] is a positive integer representing a particular year (e.g. 2024)).

On 28_AUGUST_2024 at approximately 6:00PM Pacific Standard Time, I went to the Best Buy store in Dublin, California to pickup an unlocked and pre-owned Android Galaxy A03 smartphone which I ordered at the same time I ordered a new laptop using what remained on my $500 Best Buy gift card. That phone came with a nice USB-C-to-USB cable which does not seem to wiggle around in the charging port like the other USB-C cables I have do (and I remember being disappointed with buying new versions of that phone from other retail outlets such as Target and finding that the only cable which came in the box with those phones were mostly useless USB-C-to-USB-C cables almost as though to say “fuck you; you’ll have to spend more money on USB-C-to-USB cable or else get an adapter”. I won’t even bother mentioning the atrocious customer service I had at some of those Target stores including how at least one of the Target employees who processed my phone purchase(s) did not register the phone(s) I purchased as being legitimately sold. (The customer service at the Dublin Best Buy for me has been consistently good. I can say that for many other stores in that area which I am a regular or semi-regular customer at)).

Anyway, once I got to one of my favorite hang-out spots, I decided to test the “new” phone (which also conveniently came with a key-like device (roughly the size and shape of a paper clip bent so that one of the ends was sticking out) which enabled me to pop open the component which stores the SIM card). That “new” phone did not have a SIM card in it (but I know I can buy a new one of those for approximately $10). I removed the SIM card in the phone which I am currently using and placed it into the “new” phone in order to test the functionality of the phone. After the phone went through approximately five minutes of setting up, I was able to browse the Internet and access my voice mail box with that “new” phone. Then I turned off that phone and put the SIM card back in the “old” phone (which is providing me an Internet connection at the time I am writing this note). I plan to keep the “new” phone safely stowed away in my room at my house of legal residence in Castro Valley until I need it (i.e. if or when the “old” phone stops being functional or if it becomes lost or stolen).
