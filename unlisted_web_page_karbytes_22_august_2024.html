<p>I have been reluctant to share with the public the unusually high number of hardships I have been facing within the past three months (especially this week and especially today) because I did not want to take the focus of my blog off what I consider to be my professional interests (i.e. what pertains to information technology and consciousness research). Because the events I have experienced have been so dramatic, I decided to share them in a public journal entry.</p>
<p>Last week my Patelco debit card and driver&#8217;s license were apparently stolen while I was not watching my wallet which was placed next to me while I was sitting on the ground charging my electronics at an outdoor electrical outlet in the courtyard outside of Philz Coffee in Sunnyvale, California. (Fortunately, I still had my PayPal Business debit card and other wallet items). Within two days of that event, I went to the Santa Clara Department of Motor Vehicles to apply for a new driver&#8217;s license (which cost approximately $40) and reported my Patelco debit card lost or stolen and ordered a free new replacement card.</p>
<p>Within the past four days my HP laptop became severely damaged (but minimally functional enough to allow me to use it despite the screen being almost completely broken except for approximately 30% of space on the left side of the screen) while I was attempting to use the laptop to charge my phone during a bike ride out in Alviso slough (and I only had one portable laptop charging battery because the other one went missing while I was walking around South Bay approximately two months ago). Fortunately, I was able to purchase, obtain, and set up my new Lenovo laptop by partitioning it with Ubuntu in addition to its native Windows 11 Home operating system (and I also installed some open source software on the Ubuntu side such as Sublime Text editor and VLC Media Player).</p>
<p>This morning I biked all the way from the Fremont baylands to the border of Sunnyvale and San Jose before I realized that my wallet was missing from my left leg pocket. In a panic and with grim determination, I bicycled back to were I thought I left my wallet in Fremont as fast as I could. Fortunately I found my wallet. Then I made my way back down to Sunnyvale to that aforementioned courtyard to charge my electronics, install some software, and make updates to my blog. (I could not help but notice a lot of people making rude comments seemingly at me but I tried to ignore them and played some loud music on my devices in an effort to block them out).</p>
<p>Then, while bicycling up Mathilda Avenue towards Sunnyvale slough and while crossing a freeway on ramp, some guy hit me with his car and sent me and the bike flying through the air for what seemed like three seconds. Thankfully, I was not injured (and neither was my laptop nor my phone) but my bicycle got bent out of shape to the extent that the back tire would not turn, the handle bars are slightly turned to the right instead of parallel to the front wheel, and some of the back wheel spokes became dislocated. I noticed the driver&#8217;s wind shield of the car that hit me was cracked significantly. The driver asked me if I was okay and I said yes and he drove off. I am now sitting at the location the collision happened typing this note.</p>
<p>I think that accident was more &#8220;my fault&#8221; than the fault of that driver because I did not look before crossing as carefully as I ought to have and, also, I was not wearing any kind of reflective gear nor light (which I already got pulled over for and issued a warning about in Dublin approximately one month ago).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It is approximately 12:08AM Pacific Standard Time on 23_AUGUST_2024. I called my parents on the phone and told them what happened and asked them if they could come pick me up and bring me back to Castro Valley so that, hopefully tomorrow, I can take my bicycle into the local bike shop and (hopefully) get the bike back in functional condition.</p>
<p>At this time, I am waiting for one of my parents to arrive to pick me up near the freeway entrance. From now on, I am going to try to stay proactive and keep doing things which I think are productive, worthwhile, and which make me feel more good than bad. Future updates to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a> (i.e. the collection of web-based digital files) might be less frequent than past updates to that collection were due to the fact that I intend for future updates to be relatively compact and constrained to mostly what I consider to be &#8220;professional&#8221; subject matter (instead of subject matter which is what I consider to be excessively informal, personal, and banal).</p>
<p>It seems that I try my best to be careful but I still seem unable to avoid getting into accidents and hardships I do not foresee happening before they do. That is partially why I feel the need to keep my blog updates less frequent and more succinct than they used to be. I am honestly a bit scared about getting hurt or otherwise seriously inconvenienced (with the reasoning that, as I grow older, the chances that bad things will happen to me are steadily if not sharply increasing). What I mean to imply (as morbid as it may sound to some) is that, as the total number of karbytes updates approaches infinity, each successive update feels increasingly more and more like my final blog update. (<span style="background:#00ff00">Ideally, I would be immortal, immune to serious injury, and have the means to travel across different &#8220;planes&#8221; of existence while retaining the same sense of self identity.</span> Perhaps a more &#8220;modest&#8221; goal is to live for as long and as comfortably as I can and while making the most of every opportunity I get to do something which I think is worthwhile (i.e. something which seems to net more benefit than cost)).</p>
