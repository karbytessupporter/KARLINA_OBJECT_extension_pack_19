The program user inputs exactly four values: N (which is the total number of elements to include in the array), T (which is the total number of unique nonnegative integer values which each element of the array can be instantiated as exactly one of per program runtime instance), x (which is the target nonnegative integer value to search for in the array), and c (which is the nonnegative integer corresponding with a particular choice of searching algorithm to use).</span></p>

<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_19/main/search_compare.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>search_compare.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ search_compare.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following commands (in top-down order) to install the C/C++ compiler (which is part of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>):</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-get install g++</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number, N, which is no larger than 100000 (to represent the total number of elements to store in the array named A):</pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for N using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: After a value for N is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a nonnegative integer, T, which is no larger than 100000 (to represent the total number of states each element of A can represent exactly one of per instance):</pre>
<p>STEP_8: Enter a value for T using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_9: After a value for T is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a nonnegative integer value, x, which is no larger than 100000 to search for in the array named A:</pre>
<p>STEP_10: Enter a value for x using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_11: After a value for x is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>SEARCH ALGORITHMS:

0: LINEAR_SEARCH
1: BINARY_SEARCH
2: TERNARY_SEARCH
3: FIBONACCI_SEARCH
4: EXPONENTIAL_SEARCH
5: JUMP_SEARCH

Enter either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 to store in the variable named c and which represents one of the above search algorithm choices to implement (to return the first instance of x in A and to determine how long that takes in seconds):</pre>
<p>STEP_12: Enter a value for c using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_13: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_19/main/search_compare_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>
