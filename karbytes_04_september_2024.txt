Starting at approximately 11:00PM Pacific Standard Time last night, I heard that “disembodied voice” (labeled by me as “pig_gorl”) beginning to emit distressed (and intentionally distressing) sounds which included many abusive words targeted specifically and exclusively at me (seemingly in an attempt to trigger a panic attack in me). The noises started as slow, rhythmic, and incessant “waves” of her making relatively low-pitched mooing sounds which wavered only by a single half-note and sounded like they were “building up” to something louder, higher-pitched, and more explicitly angry. That “build up” phase lasted for approximately three consecutive hours before evolving into the aforementioned sounds I predicted they would. At the time I was drifting in and out of sleep (and took one psilomethoxin pill in the hopes that it would aid my slumber and induce constructive thoughts). Around 3:30AM this morning is when her noises were the most spiteful, histrionic, and angry I recall ever hearing them. She seemed to demand that I admit that I think men are inherently superior to women (and, just to get her to shut up or move along to her next point, I flippantly told her (mentally, not out loud vocally) that her accusation was correct (which made her even more livid and hateful-sounding towards me (and at that point she was apparently having a panic attack because I did not bother “correcting” what I said)).

The bitch demanded that I shut up and allow her space to exist in my attention span (which I seemed to have no choice but to do (and I assumed that trying to drown her out with my own intentionally divergent and non-emotional thoughts would be ineffective and ultimately a waste of my time and energy (because I tried and it only seemed to trigger pig_gorl to react and latch onto every little subtle instance of novelty my mind had to procure as though she were in an intensely argumentative debate with me (but I was not sure what her argument was about other than the insistence that I act more histrionic, hateful, and panicked that I was being mentally raped with no means of escaping such psychological torture)).

I recalled the time I took an exceptionally large dose of psilomethoxin in powder form back in the year 2023 while camping near the logistics place I used to work at in Fremont and having a mental vision of pig_gorl being instantiated as a young woman of small stature with blonde-brown hair tightly pulled into a bun at the top of her head and a face which was contorted into a crying baby expression with eyes squinted or closed shut while staggering towards me with her arms reaching towards me and then climbing into my body as though she were a ghostly demon. I felt the uncomfortable feeling of her body parts filling my body parts from the inside of my own body and forcing me to take on all of her body’s tensions and shallow, laborious breathing (because she felt like a nervous wreck and entitled brat demanding I be her host).

Thankfully I was equipped with the aforementioned experience I had from last year involving pig_gorl taking on a more visceral and intrusive form. That experience gave me some idea of what to predict (and my predictions ended up being right: that the harpy would calm down in approximately five hours because she was going through some kind of twelve-hour cathartic release and was very demanding that I be her emotional punching bag, witness, and holding space).

After that I fell asleep and had a vivid dream that I was taking a shower at my childhood house upstairs in my mother’s bathroom wall-less-ly connected to the master suite. I was at taking a shower with AJP. Then we exited the shower and we’re standing at the adjacent bathroom sink looking at large photo albums containing lots of large-print text (which seemed religious in nature). I was, for some reason, disgruntled with AJP (who morphed into my mother) and looked at some italicized passage of text accompanied by some illustrations of flowers and people having some kind of picnic together (and the quote was apparently about the sacredness of love). In a cynical manner, I said, “I hate the word love,” while knowing that hatred was supposedly a sin and not something I was “allowed” to promote or be a host to. I don’t remember what happened after that but the other person seemed to alternate between being my mother and AJP. The next part of the dream took place downstairs in the living room attached to the wall-less kitchen. There were several binders open and lying around the tables and I saw a binder with a translucent, semi-flexible, and purple-red plastic cover which apparently contained items pertaining to me or which I thought should be in my possession. I angrily grabbed the binder and took it with me upstairs to my childhood bedroom. AJP said as I was walking away from the living room where he was sitting, “Do you wanna give that back?” The way he said that sounded like a father “politely” trying to get his wayward child to stop misbehaving. I ignored him and closed thr door of my bedroom once I arrived in it. I saw my backpack on the floor and immediately put the binder inside of the backpack so that I could be ready to defend it from AJP who I anticipated was rushing upstairs to try to wrestle the binder out of my possession. He came upstairs but suddenly turned into my mother holding a cat which looked like my diseased cat named Mickey seemingly as a peace offering. She asked me to open the door (and magically I could see through the opaque wooden door). I saw what appeared to be Mickey in “bread loaf” position looking very cute. I instantly said, “Aww,” and wanted to let go of being a grouch and opened the door. That’s when the dream ended and I woke up.

Later, after I woke up from that dream (after sleeping near the end of the public trail bordering Steven’s Creek in Mountain View, I saw a red helicopter do several drills of lifting one human at a time by a cable from one part of the baylands and then dropping each airlifted human off at some part of the baylands which was closed off to the public.

At the time of this writing I am on my way to get some food and work on my latest software application (which I expect to have done within the next three days). The purpose of me sharing this seemingly random journal entry is to document one of my most harrowing encounters with pig_gorl (which I think is someone who is paid by the military-industrial complex to bully me) in the hopes that doing so will make it easier for me to deal with her abuses in the future. Documenting her latest antics helps me notice recurring patterns in her behavior and better understand how she works (like the deterministic machine she apparently is).

Many other people besides pig_gorl seem to have a vendetta against me merely for being and preferring to be solitary, self-focused, and seeing myself as superior to many other humans (irregardless of how sexist, racist, classist, and ablist my thoughts sound). I think that such people are mostly hypocritical, jealousy-driven, anti-intellectual, and excessively preoccupied with superficial appearance. Much of what I hear from them in the form of insults and nonverbal harassment seems to be them “projecting” their suppressed and unwanted qualities onto me instead of more consciously acknowledging those (rather normal) qualities in themselves. In other words, much of what they say about me seems blatantly or mostly untrue; irrelevant and hence a waste of my time to take more seriously. Oh well! I’m taking a mostly passive and laissez-faire approach to dealing with those people instead of trying to argue with them or get them to see me in a particular way.
