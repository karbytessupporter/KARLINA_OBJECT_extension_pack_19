<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Consider this document to be a checkpoint in my blogging career signifying the start of a new era in which I adopt new practices and discard old practices. In previous blog posts I&#8217;ve written and published, I disclosed my intention to modify my behavior in some way beyond the scope of building and curating my personal websites (named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>). I now find such disclosures to be inappropriately personal and not sufficiently relevant to the enterprise of creating, curating, and preserving the body of (public domain, Internet-based, and entirely digital) intellectual property named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>. My implication is that, as of 8:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 24_AUGUST_2024, I no longer (publicly) obligate myself to uphold any particular lifestyle pattern nor belief pattern (other than perhaps purely abstract rudimentary logic which apparently gives rise to my ability to remember, synthesize, and draw relationships between discrete pieces of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information</a>). For instance, though I strongly prefer to adhere to a vegan diet or one which includes meat which is exclusively derived from humanely cultured animal cells in a laboratory, I might occasionally consume in non-vegan and non-humanely-cultured animal products in order to satisfy my nutritional needs or taste preferences (but I do fear that there might be eventual adverse consequences if I do so which cause me significant suffering). Also, I no longer forbid myself from smoking or from vaping marijuana in favor of consuming it only in edible form. That is because edibles are relatively easy to &#8220;overdose on&#8221; when all I want is a less incapacitating and less time-consuming high. In summary, I have personal values and goals which I feel intrinsic (rather than merely extrinsic) motivation to pursue. Hence I have plenty to do and plenty of built-in challenges to face and overcome along the way. I think I&#8217;ll have an easier and more enjoyable time doing whatever it is a care about (or to the best of my ability if in a &#8220;hostage situation&#8221; doing things with little to no agency but doing them nevertheless as part of involuntarily or voluntarily existing).</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>karbytes</p>
<p>P.S. I presently hold the view that free will (i.e. agency) is an emergent property arising from relatively (if not completely) involuntary and relatively (if not completely) unconscious processes within the hardware of an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> such as a human or robot. Hence, I presently believe that I have some degree of legitimate free will (which is a godlike ability to consciously manifest phenomena including the phenomenon of selecting what I think is the most personally beneficial behavioral option from a set of multiple potential behavioral options at a given point in my lifetime).</p>
<p>Also, I would like to clarify what I mean by &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; verses &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; motivation. I define <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intrinsic motivation</a> as a compulsion of an information processing agent to do something primarily or exclusively as a consequence of believing that doing so will cause that information processing agent to feel an increase in the sense that the information processing agent&#8217;s experience is worthwhile to that information processing agent (perhaps by increasing or sustaining the degree to which that information processing agent feels pleasurable emotions). By contrast, I consider <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_(penology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extrinsic motivation</a> to be a compulsion of an information processing agent to do something primarily to avoid being punished by that information processing agent&#8217;s environment governing structure and rule-enforcing agents.</p>
