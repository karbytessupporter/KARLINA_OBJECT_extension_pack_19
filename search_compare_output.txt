Enter a natural number, N, which is no larger than 1000 (to represent the total number of elements to store in the array named A): 

The value which was entered for N is 1000.

Enter a nonnegative integer, T, which is no larger than 1000 (to represent the total number of states each element of A can represent exactly one of per instance): 

The value which was entered for T is 1000.
