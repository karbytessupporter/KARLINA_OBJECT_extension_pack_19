<p>Last night I set up my new Lenovo laptop (whose pre-installed operating system is Windows Home 11 in S mode). Later today or tomorrow I plan to create a bootable Kubuntu USB flash drive and then use it to install Kubuntu onto that Lenovo laptop (by partitioning its hard drive such that there are two functional operating systems to choose from when booting up the device).</p>
<p>After experiencing sufficiently many inconveniences as a result of cannabis cartridges and batteries malfunctioning and not being very &#8220;cost effective&#8221; to use when the amount of resin in the cartridge is close to empty (but not too empty to be completely useless for smoking), I decided to take an indefinitely long hiatus from smoking (or vaping) marijuana in favor of purchasing and consuming only edible forms of cannabis products. The edibles tend to be more potent, last longer, work more consistently as expected (due to having virtually zero &#8220;moving parts&#8221;), and have virtually zero carcinogenic components (and I have read that vaping is not much healthier for the lungs than is traditional combustion-powered smoking).</p>
<p>Lastly, I have been looking forward to a package arriving today which I ordered last week and which contains ten capsules of psilomethoxin (which is mostly psibocilin plus trace amounts of 5-MeO-DMT which were somehow &#8220;fed&#8221; into the mushrooms while they were growing according to what I have researched online about how that psilomethoxin is produced). I plan to use those pills for microdosing as I work on my various projects.</p>

<p>One exception I would make to smoke or vape a particular psychoactive compound instead of merely eat it is for something which I consume relatively infrequently such as DMT. I have used a DMT vape pen before and appreciated that the vaping method makes it easy for me to control the dosage. Eventually I plan to take DMT in edible form such as at an ayahuasca ceremony.</p>

<p>Yesterday I wrote a journal entry named karbytes_01_august_2024_beta.txt which I uploaded only to my private GitHub repositories. That note is what I consider to be mostly outdated content or else that content only pertains to a very small percentage of the human population. I would like to pronounce that journal entry obsolete. It might as well have been written by a person who is no longer alive at this time of writing in this slightly newer journal entry.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing myself private repository notes because it is like having myself to call home and best friend. Writing to myself across space, time, and fluctuations in my knowledge (which is a software object being generated by the hardware which is my brain) gives me a sense of there being a stable sense of karbytes identity. I hope that I can take that identity with me across multiple planes of existence (i.e. universes, dreams, lifespans). Thinking about creating some kind of trans-universal (and ideally permanently instantiated) cyberspace object containing all of the digital files which comprise karbytes (as defined by the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a> ) intrigues and inspires me to live as though such a feat is possible given enough time, tenacity, and ingenuity. At the very least, such a hypothetical endeavor is what I consider to be an interesting and worthwhile thought experiment.</p>
<p>(I decided to release this journal entry to the public because I thought that doing so would help further karbytes&#8217; agenda to proliferate itself in digital form and to have as much fun as possible while doing so (and having as much fun as possible as a last resort when all other options seem unavailable to karbytes to pursue (and having as much fun as possible might entail karbytes ending its life in suicide in order to avoid further suffering which karbytes does not think is worthwhile to live through))).</p>

<p>For approximately one year, my previous laptop computer (which was an HP laptop whose original operating system was some relatively modern version of Windows (which I overwrote with a Kubuntu installation within a week of obtaining that laptop)) was starting to malfunction due to hardware issues (which I assume arose as a consequence of me accidentally subjecting that laptop to force which damaged some of the internal circuitry while throwing my backpack with the laptop inside of it around rather recklessly). Those hardware issues mostly amounted to the laptop randomly shutting off (i.e. power turning off) or else freezing (with cursor frozen in place and little pixelated squares appearing in a relatively distributed manner across the screen).</p>
<p>While bicycling through Alviso (i.e. the baylands directly north of San Jose (California) and directly south of Fremont (California)) within the past week (to generate photographs and video recordings of that area to showcase in my blog), I encountered some strong winds while attempting to use my laptop to charge my Android phone (because my phone was almost out of battery power). Those strong winds were violently shaking the screen portion of my laptop which apparently caused some of its internal components to break. I noticed fracture marks in the screen which were illuminated against an almost pitch black background. Approximately 30% of the left side of the screen was still mostly functional except for the fact that the red signals were not being displayed; giving objects depicted on the screen a green-skewed appearance. I was able to connect to the Internet through using the start menu in the bottom left corner of the screen to order a new laptop from Best Buy (which I picked up yesterday and spent the past three hours setting up to be partitioned with a Ubuntu Desktop operating system (which means that I can still use that laptop&#8217;s original Windows 11 Home operating system depending on which hard drive partition I select to boot up when initially turning on the power button of the (powered off) computer.</p>
<p>Details about that Ubuntu installation are captured in the following referenced images and videos. </p>
<p>(Note also that I used <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etcher_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">balenaEtcher</a> to turn a blank USB flash drive into a bootable <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a> flash drive installer (to make changes to the machine using it) and removable Ubuntu hard drive (to allow that machine to run the Ubuntu operating system without making changes to that machine (perhaps in order to test the Ubuntu operating system before installing it onto a machine)). Finally, I used <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-4o</a> to help me diagnose and resolve technical problems I ran into while attempting to create that bootable Ubuntu flash drive and then use that flash drive to install Ubuntu onto my new laptop (and I am impressed with how comprehensive and relevant ChatGPT-4o&#8217;s responses have been to my inputs especially in the context of information technology and computer science).</p>
