<p>One of my main motivations (if not the main motivation) for building a personal <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> is to give myself a relatively permanent <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House" target="_blank" rel="noopener">house</a> for my mind to call home (irregardless of where my body is located). Unlike a &#8220;real&#8221; house, a personal website (which is not the same thing as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> account due to the fact that the user of that account ultimately has no ultimate administrative authority nor ultimate intellectual property ownership of that account nor the content it hosts) is a &#8220;place&#8221; where the creator of that personal website has total authority and control over what is published on that website and how that website is essentially structured and does not necessarily have to get legal permission nor pay money to obtain and maintain such (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberspace</a>) &#8220;real estate&#8221;. No matter where I go, I can always visit my home in cyberspace (provided I have an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet</a> connection with the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web</a>) for as long as I live (because I intend to never delete my websites and I intend to meticulously archive them on the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> at <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive dot Org</a> and by burning all of those websites&#8217; constituent files to long-term storage devices such as <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M_DISCs</a>).</p>
<p>(Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll have (metaphorically geographically distant) &#8220;neighbors&#8221; in cyberspace (i.e. friends who construct their own elaborate and highly-personalized cyberspace homes) who I can exchange ideas with and we can explore and comment on each other&#8217;s homes through the interconnective mediums of email and social media public. To some extent that is already the case (especially with <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>). Still, I have yet to meet any person (other than myself)who is similarly obsessed with building and curating its own similarly elaborate home in cyberspace. Perhaps very few people have sufficient free time, civil liberty, and infrastructural support to do so. Perhaps someday they will. Even if I never meet another person who shares this obsession, I find this obsession to be absolutely intrinsically worthwhile for the incomparable comfort and joy it consistently gives me. I love building, curating, and exploring my personal websites! I think of them as being one gigantic house in the middle of some sprawling alpine forest (without any other buildings nearby for more than one thousand kilometers in all spatial directions)).</p>
<p>There is exactly one &#8220;room&#8221; of that &#8220;house&#8221; which is designed (by its sole builder and sole inhabitant (which is the same person (i.e. karbytes))) to be relatively hidden because that &#8220;room&#8221; contains &#8220;paraphernalia&#8221; which is considered (by karbytes) to be incongruous with karbytes&#8217; idealized personal brand image. That &#8220;room&#8221; is referred to as &#8220;box_of_gems&#8221; and may be visualized as being a basement which is located deep underground and the deepest underground and hardest to get to room of its encompassing house. That &#8220;room&#8221; may be visualized as being windowless, short in height but rather large in terms of floor space, cramped full of shelves which are narrowly spaced apart and forming what looks like a labyrinth in some underground <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warehouse</a>, full of weird smells and occasional weird sounds, and not very well-lit with flickering fluorescent lights (many of them hardly emitting any light) and broken pieces of equipment and other random scraps strewn about on the floor and hanging off the shelves).</p>
<p>(By contrast, a large, well-lit, clean, luxurious, and well-organized &#8220;room&#8221; attached to the &#8220;front door&#8221; of that &#8220;house&#8221; is the home page of this website (i.e. the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>). Also, a similarly large, well-lit, clean, luxurious, and well-organized &#8220;room&#8221; is &#8220;located&#8221; directly above this website&#8217;s home page &#8220;room&#8221; (using a large spiraling &#8220;staircase&#8221; to connect those two palace-like &#8220;rooms&#8221;). That second-story &#8220;room&#8221; is the home page of the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>).</p>
<p>In order to visit that (relatively hidden) web page referred to as &#8220;the most underground room&#8221; in its encompassing &#8220;house&#8221;, the prospective visitor of that &#8220;deeply underground room&#8221; must append the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL</a> of this website&#8217;s home page with the aforementioned name of that (relatively hidden) web page (using a forward slash character (i.e. &#8216;/&#8217;) immediately to the right of the &#8216;.com&#8217; part of the home page URL and immediately to the left of the name of that (relatively hidden) web page OR else access that (relatively hidden) web page by using the one and only (deliberately misleading) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlink</a> which leads to that (relatively hidden) web page on exactly one of the &#8220;micro directory&#8221; web pages of the one and only &#8220;macro directory&#8221; of this website. </p>
<p>(The latter method to visit the aforementioned (relatively hidden) web page implies that literally <span style="background:#00ff00">ALL files (including web pages and media files which are referenced via (public karbytes-created and exclusively karbytes-owned GitHub repository) hyperlinks or else embedded in web pages of this website) which comprise the body of intellectual property referred to as <strong>karbytes</strong> (according to the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABOUT_KARBYTES</a> of this website (i.e. the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com))) is accessible by following hyperlinks starting from the home page of this website).</span>
