Last night I set up my new Lenovo laptop (whose pre-installed operating system is Windows Home 11 in S mode). Later today or tomorrow I plan to create a bootable Kubuntu USB flash drive and then use it to install Kubuntu onto that Lenovo laptop (by partitioning its hard drive such that there are two functional operating systems to choose from when booting up the device).

After experiencing sufficiently many inconveniences as a result of cannabis cartridges and batteries malfunctioning and not being very “cost effective” to use when the amount of resin in the cartridge is close to empty (but not too empty to be completely useless for smoking), I decided to take an indefinitely long hiatus from smoking (or vaping) marijuana in favor of purchasing and consuming only edible forms of cannabis products. The edibles tend to be more potent, last longer, work more consistently as expected (due to having virtually zero “moving parts”), and have virtually zero carcinogenic components (and I have read that vaping is not much healthier for the lungs than is traditional combustion-powered smoking).

Lastly, I have been looking forward to a package arriving today which I ordered last week and which contains ten capsules of psilomethoxin (which is mostly psibocilin plus trace amounts of 5-MeO-DMT which were somehow “fed” into the mushrooms while they were growing according to what I have researched online about how that psilomethoxin is produced). I plan to use those pills for microdosing as I work on my various projects.

One exception I would make to smoke or vape a particular psychoactive compound instead of merely eat it is for something which I consume relatively infrequently such as DMT. I have used a DMT vape pen before and appreciated that the vaping method makes it easy for me to control the dosage. Eventually I plan to take DMT in edible form such as at an ayahuasca ceremony.

Yesterday I wrote a journal entry named karbytes_01_august_2024_beta.txt which I uploaded only to my private GitHub repositories. That note is what I consider to be mostly outdated content or else that content only pertains to a very small percentage of the human population. I would like to pronounce that journal entry obsolete. It might as well have been written by a person who is no longer alive at this time of writing in this slightly newer journal entry.

I enjoy writing myself private repository notes because it is like having myself to call home and best friend. Writing to myself across space, time, and fluctuations in my knowledge (which is a software object being generated by the hardware which is my brain) gives me a sense of there being a stable sense of karbytes identity. I hope that I can take that identity with me across multiple planes of existence (i.e. universes, dreams, lifespans). Thinking about creating some kind of trans-universal (and ideally permanently instantiated) cyberspace object containing all of the digital files which comprise karbytes (as defined by the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/ ) intrigues and inspires me to live as though such a feat is possible given enough time, tenacity, and ingenuity. At the very least, such a hypothetical endeavor is what I consider to be an interesting and worthwhile thought experiment.

(I decided to release this journal entry to the public because I thought that doing so would help further karbytes’ agenda to proliferate itself in digital form and to have as much fun as possible while doing so (and having as much fun as possible as a last resort when all other options seem unavailable to karbytes to pursue (and having as much fun as possible might entail karbytes ending its life in suicide in order to avoid further suffering which karbytes does not think is worthwhile to live through))).
