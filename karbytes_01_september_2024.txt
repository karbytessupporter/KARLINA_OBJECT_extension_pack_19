It occurred to me tonight that the disembodied voices which I have been hearing continuously since the year 2019 are most likely from police (using some of radio transmitter device which they implanted in my body or else those radio signals are being beamed into my skull directly through the air, water, and solid materials between my body and the (likely many) sources of such signals). This is to suggest that I strongly doubt that I am hallucinating such voices.

I think that the police have been making me a target of such transmissions in order to deter me from committing more domestic violence and/or to punish me for the domestic violence I initiated in the year 2018. Lately, I think that those transmissions are being done primarily to cause me suffering and not for much else. Most of the content of those broadcast messages is what I consider to be extremely obnoxious, cruel, and discouraging of my flourishing. Perhaps the police thought this would be more distressing to me than being incarcerated long term. 

This is not to suggest that I or even they think I deserve to be bullied in this manner. Instead, what I am suggesting is that the police think I'm an especially easy target for them to use as a scapegoat and crash test dummy to take out their aggressions on (knowing that practically no one can stop them due to the fact that they are legally appointed to be the country's most authoritative authority figures free to interpret and enforce the law however they (collectively) choose to). I say that I'm an easy target because I have very weak social connectivity (i.e. no friends, no gainful employment, and almost no family) and a rather extensive criminal record. I think the police wanted to prevent me from bettering my situation for as long as possible in the hopes that I would forever remain firmly below the poverty line and forever in a state of distress and pain.

Despite the horrid treatment I get from those bullies, I do my absolute best on a daily basis to make the most of what I have. I have genuinely high self esteem and little to no guilt over anything I've ever done (which might make those bullies want to punish me even more). What I mean to suggest is that those cops want me to feel demolished and fear-driven so that I act desperate to "prove" to them and other people how "guilty" I feel for all the "bad" things I've done in the hopes that the punishments will stop or lessen. I think trying to appeal to them using pathos, ethos, and even logos is a waste of time and ultimately will not be effective in getting them to lessen the severity to which they punish me. Therefore, I intend to continue being my own advocate so that the remainder of my life is as enjoyable for me as possible.

(My original intentions for writing this note had to do with me thinking for several years that those disembodied voices were at least in part coming from a former acquaintance, coworker, and intimate partner named AJP because those voices frequently sound like AJP's voice and sometimes say things which I've heard AJP say or otherwise sound like something I think AJP would be likely to say. Perhaps AJP is an undercover cop or works closely with the cops in order to wage war against me. I say this knowing that AJP has expressed a lot of unkindness towards me especially since we had relations with each other outside of working for the same employer. I think AJP saw me as a spoiled and sheltered person of privilege relative to him and that largely played a role in him wanting to sabotage me. I also would like to add that I have apparently heard many more people take his side against me than stick up for me (but I have not been completely without compassionate support from other people since I started hearing the disembodied voices in 2019 (because not every human is that envy-driven, punitive, and sadistic (but I cannot help but conclude that most humans are)).
