I imagine there are people in my life who are implicitly saying to me, "I want to make sure that you don't have a good start to your day nor any elaborate thoughts in your head. Instead, I demand that you stay indefinitely preoccupied with the belligerent antics of envy-driven, power-hungry, status-obsessed 'juveniles' who seem to outnumber you almost anywhere you go. They don't like the fact that you have your own culture, identity, and worldview beyond what they seem to think should be the one and only ideology, ontology, and actual manifestation of human potential. What those 'juveniles' demand is that you be more like them and less like you (and what they are is incessantly chatty, hostile towards those they secretly envy (i.e. people who have the means to be relatively polite, professional, and intellectual rather than merely physical as a non-human animal embroiled in some lifelong struggle for territorial acquisition and continued possession of such (and such 'territory' includes women's bodies, offspring, and all forms of material commodities or keepsakes)."

My implication with that previous paragraph is that I think there are people who exist who really embody what that quotation in the previous paragraph stated and that such people are aggressively opposed to me having a white collar career (especially one which emphasizes having a relatively robust background in computer science and software development). 

Finally, I cannot help but notice that one of the 'voices of the Community' which seems to be intensely preoccupied with my activity (both physical and mental) is demanding I be too emotionally riled up and feeling victimized to embody my ideals. I imagine her to be a Black and/or Hispanic/Latino woman in her late thirties (but intellectually and emotionally resembling someone in their late teens) with eyes bulging in anger and lips curled in a perpetual snarl while her front teeth resemble a horse naying. I also imagine her head looks disproportionately big for her relatively child-sized body which is clad in sexually revealing and unambiguously feminine attire. I imagine her face is more wide than it is round; slightly neonatal in its proportions. She is constantly flapping her gums in an angry whining manner. She sounds like she wants me to be her cathartic release valve. She seems to insist that I be seen by others as a violent, angry, poor, and slovenly thug so that people deny me decent employment opportunities. 

In the past I made audio impersonations of her and referred to her using the moniker pig_gorl. The complete list of such audio recordings is available on the following web page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/pig_gorl/

In a slightly more general context, I do mean to imply that so-called minorities are likely "overcompensating" (especially women) for what they think they lack by behaving in an excessively exhibitionist and bratty manner. Otherwise, I assume they would demonstrate more composure. At the moment I write this (while at Civic Center  BART station in San Francisco, California) I here some man (who I assume is Black (and its practically required by "the Community" that I always capitalize the "b" in "Black" when referring to the respective race while not doing the same for other human races)) yelling for several minutes nonstop that someone like me is committing the heinous crime of talking to myself (or to others) about myself instead of dutifully shutting up and keeping my mental activity to a bare minimum so as to not "put on airs" of intellectual sophistication and hence superiority. 

For the record, I do my absolute best on a daily basis to not offend other people regardless of whether or not other people return the (mostly unacknowledged) favor. I am unwilling to subjugate myself to any "authority" other than myself (which is what seemingly many humans cannot stand). Because of what I have experienced, I cannot help but see most humans as too impatient, intellectually underdeveloped (and lazy), anthropocentric (especially with regards to a chauvinist male dominated social hierarchy), and controlling for me to want close interpersonal relationships with humans. Instead, I generally restrict my involvement with other people to online communications only (for topics I consider to be socially controversial or just too niche for the general public to want to allow space for even existing) and to strictly business-like and pragmatic transactions only. I consider Nature to be my one and only "higher power" and I am frequently rewarded by Nature's bounty in ways which make humanity in general seem stingy and punitive in comparison.

Also, for the record, my default plan is to resume working in a warehouse as a seasonal employee (particularly with Amazon) later this year. In all honesty, I am "secretly" trying for a job which is more similar to the job I had while working as a software development intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory spanning the years 2012 and 2015. Perhaps I'll find a decent remote or hybrid remote/in-person job. (I still here that man yelling and I thought I heard him insinuate I'm a spoiled entitled "princess" for ideating about such relatively high-brow career prospects).

Okay, now it is time for me to pretend I did not make this note and publish it anyway (for the sake that such a note helps at least myself to better understand what is going through my mind as I navigate my prolonged unemployment situation in the hopes of attaining a more dignified standard of living).
