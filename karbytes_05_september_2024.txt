Some people think subjective existence is “just a movie” while some other people think that subjective existence is “actually a video-game”.

I find it tempting to say that, while it is demonstratively possible to watch a movie inside of a video game, it is logically impossible to play a video game while merely watching “just a movie” in an entirely passive manner.
