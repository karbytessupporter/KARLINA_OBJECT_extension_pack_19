<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>This is a follow-up to the previous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_26_august_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> which I wrote on 26_AUGUST_2024 (and that previous journal entry is what I consider to be &#8220;insufficiently professional&#8221; instead of &#8220;sufficiently professional&#8221; according to my personal standards in pertinence to karbytes content (and karbytes, in this context, refers to the body of (public domain) Internet-based intellectual property (in the form of digital files (which are each ultimately reducible to exactly one unique sequence of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> which is &#8220;machine readable&#8221; and used to verbatim reconstitute the &#8220;higher dimensional&#8221; data which that &#8220;one dimensional&#8221; sequence of binary digits encodes) described by the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a>)).</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I have had only a minimal amount of &#8220;industry experience&#8221; working as a (paid) employee whose primary job was to write, test, and document software (and that job took place at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 01_JUNE_2012 to 30_SEPTEMBER_2015 (and what that software was almost entirely written in <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Apps_Script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Apps Script</a> (which is a Google-proprietary form of JavaScript used to interface with various Google cloud-based applications such as Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets))). I only made approximately $13.65 per hour at that part-time internship job and have not worked in any office job since then (but I have held various &#8220;blue collar&#8221; jobs such as working as an entry-level employee in restaurants, retail outlets, and warehouses). What I want to emphasize in this journal entry is that I would rather not require that I have a &#8220;white collar&#8221; job in order to call myself a software engineer or computer geek. Instead, I would rather devote myself to making software development, computer science, and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STEM</a> subjects in general a core part of my (lifelong) hobbies so that my involvement in such things is not contingent upon me being employed for pay in such domains.</p>
<p>I believe that thinking of myself as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hobbyist</a> software developer is ultimately more rewarding than being employed full-time or even part-time as a software developer because, as a hobbyist only, I get to choose exactly which projects to work on and I get to set my own deadlines (instead of be told what to work on and when by someone other than myself). This is not to say that I am completely closed off to the prospect of someday becoming employed as a full-time or part-time software developer. What I am insinuating is that I think that I might be happiest treating my interest in computer science and other related domains as something which I would pay to do rather than only do if I am paid to do it.</p>
<p>This might not be what some people want to hear. I suspect that some people are hoping that I bust my ass trying to become (and then perhaps eventually become) a full-time software engineer who feels overworked, underpaid, and deprived of sufficient free time and creative freedom to live more closely to how I idealize living. I am afraid that pursuing and/or obtaining a job as a paid software engineer would ultimately be more of a cost to me than a benefit (but other people might be content to exploit me as their slave).</p>
<p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t think I have much say over when I am employed, how long I am employed, who I work with, what happens while on the job, and where I work (though I do have some limited say over where I work and in what role because I at least get to choose where I send job applications and, so far, no one can legally force me to go to work). Because I have so little say over the conditions in which I work for pay, I decided to not let that part of my life define my sense of self. I would rather base my self concept on what I choose to do as hobbies beyond the scope of what society recognizes as being worthy of pay and accolades.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>karbytes</p>
